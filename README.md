# Java 40

This is comes from a [post on X](https://x.com/SumitM_X/status/1852732754854588575) which mentions 40 topics every backend Java developer should understand.

I probably do understand the majority of the topics but since I am not using them daily, I will create and share this repo where I will create documentation for each of the 40 topics.

## Topics

[CAP Theorem](CAP_Theorem.md)

[Consistency Models](Consistency_Models.md)
